# Syncfusion Flutter Gauges

Syncfusion flutter gauges library includes data visualization widgets such as radial gauge, which is written in dart, to create modern, interactive, and animated gauges that are used to craft high-quality mobile app user interfaces using Flutter.

## Overview

The radial gauge is used to display numerical values on a circular scale. It has a rich set of features such as axes, ranges, pointers, and annotations that are fully customizable and extendable. Use it to create speedometers, temperature monitors, dashboards, meter gauges, multi-axis clocks, watches, modern activity gauges, compasses and more. 

**Disclaimer:** This is a commercial package. To use this package, you need to have either Syncfusion Commercial License or Syncfusion Community license. For more details, please check the [LICENSE](https://github.com/syncfusion/flutter-examples/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

**Note:** This package does not yet support the web platform.

## Radial gauge features

* **Axes** - The radial gauge axis is a circular arc in which a set of values are displayed along a linear or custom scale based on the design requirements. Axis elements, such as labels, ticks, and axis line, can be easily customized with built-in properties.

* **Ranges** - Gauge range is a visual element that helps to quickly visualize where a value falls on the axis. The text can be easily annotated in range to improve the readability.

* **Pointers** - Pointer is used to indicate values on an axis. It has three types of pointers: needle pointer, marker pointer, and range pointer. All the pointers can be customized as needed.

* **Animation** - Animates the pointer in a visually appealing way when the pointer moves from one value to another. Gauge supports various pointer animations. It is also possible to apply initial load animation for gauge.

* **Pointer interaction** - Radial gauge provides an option to drag a pointer from one value to another. It is used to change the value at run time.

* **Annotations** - Add multiple widgets such as text and image as an annotation at a specific point of interest in the radial gauge.

## Installation

Install the latest version from [pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/syncfusion_flutter_gauges#-installing-tab-).

## Getting started

Import the following package.

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_gauges/gauges.dart';
```
### Add radial gauge to the widget tree

Add the radial gauge widget as a child of any widget. Here, the gauge widget is added as a child of container widget.

```dart
@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          child: SfRadialGauge()
      ))),
    );
  }
```
### Add radial gauge elements

Add the gauge elements such as axis, range, pointer, and annotation to display different color ranges, add pointer to indicate the current value, and add annotation to show the current value.

```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          child: SfRadialGauge(
          axes: <RadialAxis>[
            RadialAxis(minimum: 0, maximum: 150,
            ranges: <GaugeRange>[
              GaugeRange(startValue: 0, endValue: 50, color:Colors.green),
              GaugeRange(startValue: 50,endValue: 100,color: Colors.orange),
              GaugeRange(startValue: 100,endValue: 150,color: Colors.red)],
            pointers: <GaugePointer>[
              NeedlePointer(value: 90)],
            annotations: <GaugeAnnotation>[
              GaugeAnnotation(widget: Container(child: 
                 Text('90.0',style: TextStyle(fontSize: 25,fontWeight: FontWeight.bold))),
                 angle: 90, positionFactor: 0.5
              )]
          )])
      ))),
    );
  }
```
